# UFOs

## Overview
The object of this project was to create a webpage containing a table with UFO sighting data.  Using Javascript a user can input a variety in criteria to filter the data and pull up specific results.

## Results

The webpage gives a little background information of those who are pro alien sightings and those against.  Also included on the webpage is an interactive table that will allow users to filter through the data and look at the following:
* date
* city
* state 
* country
* shape 
* duration
* comments

## Drawbacks

One of the biggest drawbacks is the data is "case-sensitive".  If you were to use capital letters instead of lower case letters no data is returned.
Also exact wording must be used and not partial enteries.  

## Recommendations

Would highly recommend a dropdown option to help narrow down search parameters.  Also would recommend more user friendly instructions to help navigate and filter for better results.
