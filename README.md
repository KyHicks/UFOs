# UFOs

## Overview
The object of this project was to create a webpage containing a table with UFO sighting data.  Using Javascript a user can input a variety in criteria to filter the data and pull up specific results.

## Results

The webpage gives a little background information of those who are pro alien sightings and those against.  Also included on the webpage is an interactive table that will allow users to filter through the data and look at the following:
*date
*city
*state 
*country
*shape 
*duration
*comments
